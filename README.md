First time using forms and trying to style them.

Reflection: 
I managed to get the webpage to look similar enough to the project goal with the specific functionality that was requested:

Every elemenet is roughly where it is in the image. 
The background image source at the bottom has working links that link to the artist's page and the image page. 
There is a "Log in" link that doesn't link to anything, but it's styled properly. 
Each form has validation that checks if what was inputted is correct and placeholder examples.
The passwords just have to match, no specific requirements for them. 
The page wraps so when you shrink the viewport, it doesn't completely break.


Things that could be improved:
The way I set up the form columns has them go out of order when the viewport shrinks. For example, last name doesn't come after first name. This also applies to when you try to tab through the form. I know how to fix it, just don't want to right now.
The passwords could have specific requirements set on them.
When shrinking the viewport, there is extra space on the right hand side so you can scroll horizontally even though there isn't really content there.
